:url-dotdrop: https://github.com/deadc0de6/dotdrop

Collection of dotfiles for personal use, using link:url-dotdrop[dotdrop^] for synchronization, encryption, and other features.

link:dotdrop[Dotdrop^] was chosen because it requires only on a running python installation (and local pip installation), which should be easy enough to set up on any machine, whether it runs Windows, Linux, Android, or other operation systems.

Host specific configurations are supported, settings can be tailored to different users on these machines as well.

All data is kept on github, no password is needed to clone the repo
